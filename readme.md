<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Item Trader Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Item trader project is a web api project that provides endpoints for listing items to be used in trades. The project is built for an interactive UI (Native mobile apps or Web apps having backend or not) which will provide its users ability to trade their items.
The application consists of trade items and proposals. An usual flow would be :

* User lists several items to trade.
* Sees other trade items in the system. 
* Can give a proposal for one of the items.
* The requested items owner may reject or accept the proposal. And the proposal owner can cancel the proposal if it is not accepted or rejeected yet.
* If the proposal is accepted, the trade happens. Otherwise the proposed item will be available for trading again.
* After a successful trade happens, both of the items are delisted from available to trade items list.

The Item Trader API is built with .Net Core 3.1 and using a SQL Database. 
Clean architecture design is implemented at the application. So the API has Domain and Applicaiton Layers acting as Core. An Infrastructure and a presentation layer depends on the core.

I used Mediatr while implementing CQRS which helps a lot with its pipeline, request handler and event handler features. 
I also used FluentValidation for validating requests and AutoMapper for mapping Domain objects to DTOs.

For authentication and authorization, i used IdentityServer4 with .Net Core Identity. IdentityServer itself is not an authentication server so with .Net Core identity it also provides authentication by applying Open ID Connect and OAuth protocols.

Authentication server and Item Trader API are handled as completely separated domains. The only thing these two domains share is the database. But as Domain Driven Design suggests, they have their own bounded contexts. 
While an user is represented as an application user in authentication server, the same user is represented as a Trader in Item Trader API. 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started with the project



Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
